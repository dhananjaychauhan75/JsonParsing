Welcome to our demo project showcasing how to efficiently utilize JSON parsing within iOS applications. We've implemented two methods to achieve this seamlessly:

JSON Serialization: This method provides a straightforward approach to parsing JSON data in iOS. It involves using built-in classes like JSONSerialization to convert JSON data into Swift objects, allowing for easy manipulation and integration within your application's logic.
JSON Decoding: Alternatively, we've incorporated JSON decoding, a powerful feature introduced in Swift 4, to streamline the parsing process. By leveraging Swift's Codable protocol, this method offers a more intuitive and type-safe approach to parsing JSON data. With JSON decoding, you can directly map JSON structures to Swift structs or classes, reducing boilerplate code and enhancing readability.
We invite you to explore both methods within our codebase to discover the best approach suited for your specific project requirements. Each method is meticulously crafted to ensure optimal performance and maintainability, empowering you to efficiently handle JSON data in your iOS applications.

Happy coding!
